 * `PolicyProposals` oversees the proposals phase of the policy decision
 * process. Proposals can be submitted by anyone willing to put forth funds, and
 * submitted proposals can be supported by anyone
 *
 * First, during the proposals portion of the proposals phase, proposals can be
 * submitted (for a fee). This is parallelized with a signal voting process where
 * support can be distributed and redistributed to proposals after they are submitted.
 *
 * A proposal that makes it to support above 30% of the total possible support ends this
