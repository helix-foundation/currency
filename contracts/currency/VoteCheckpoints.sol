/**
 * @dev Extension of ERC20 to support Compound-like voting and delegation. This version is more generic than Compound's,
 * and supports token supply up to 2^224^ - 1, while COMP is limited to 2^96^ - 1.
 *
 * This extension keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's vote power. Vote power can be delegated either
 * by calling the {delegate} function directly, or by providing a signature to be used with {delegateBySig}. Voting
 * power can be queried through the public accessors {getVotingGons} and {getPastVotingGons}.
 *
 * By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it
 * requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.
 * Enabling self-delegation can easily be done by overriding the {delegates} function. Keep in mind however that this
 * will significantly increase the base gas cost of transfers.
 *
 * _Available since v4.2._
